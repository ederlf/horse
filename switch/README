Trema Switch: Trema-based OpenFlow switch implementation

Trema Switch consists of two submodules, a protocol and a datapath.
Those two modules implemented as two seperate threads. The protocol
thread would either receive message from controller or the datapath
thread. If a message received from the controller needs to be handled
by the datapath it would translate the message and call the appropriate
datapath function to execute it. In other cases it might simply return
a reply back to controller. Messages from the datapath are passed via
a message queue.

The rake command creates the switch executable under objects/switch/
switch/switch. The executable name is switch and to avoid name clashing
with the previous switch_manager/switch program the switch_manager/
switch has been renamed to switch_manager/switch_daemon.

The switch program can be run using the following steps:

1. Set TREMA_HOME environment variable to where the top trema-edge
   repository resides.

  $ export TREMA_HOME=/somewhere/trema-edge

2. Run the switch executable like follows:

  $ cd $TREMA_HOME
  $ sudo -E ./objects/switch/switch/switch --datapath_id=1 \
  --server_ip=10.0.0.1 --server_port=6653 --switch_ports=eth0,eth1

  This would create and use a datapath_id of 1 attempt to connect to
  controller with ip address 10.0.0.1 using the port 6333. Two switch
  ports are associated with the specified Ethernet devices.
